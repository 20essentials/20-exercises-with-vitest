  The Last Challenge is a Maze
  - Exercise from: https://2022.adventjs.dev/challenges/2022/24

  It's the day! Today we're going to deliver giftsâ€¦ but the warehouses are a maze and the elves are lost.

  Indielfo Jones wants to write a program that, upon receiving a matrix, knows if it can quickly exit the maze from its entrance to the exit.

  Mazes have the following positions:

  W: It's a wall, you can't pass through there. S: Entry point to the warehouse. E: Exit point from the warehouse. : White spaces are where you can pass through.

  Valid movements are from one position up, down, left, or right. You can't move diagonally.

  Remember that:

  You only have to return whether you can exit the maze with a boolean.
  You can't jump over W walls.
  You can't exit the limits of the matrix, you always have to follow an internal path.
